## Overview
Implement K-NN algorithm from the scratch - that can determine if a particular review is fake (1) or not (0).

## Scoring Metric
Since the dataset is imbalanced the scoring function will be the F1-score(that considers both precision and recall) instead of Accuracy.

## Data Description

The training dataset consists of 800 records and the test dataset consists of 350 records.

The attributes are binary type and as such are presented in a sparse matrix format
